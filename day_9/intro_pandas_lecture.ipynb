    "Tonight we're going to be starting our journey through the Pandas library (created by Wes McKinney). When we refer to working in Pandas, we're typically talking about working within a dataframe, which is what we'll focus on tonight. We'll be diving into Pandas DataFrames, which are objects that will hold our data, allowing us to interact with it, manipulate it, and eventually throw it into machine learning algorithms (if we want). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Pandas DataFrame is an **object**, this means that we're going to interact with it in much the same way that we interact with all of our other objects in python. Before we get to actually interacting with DataFrames, though, we'll have to get one, and get one with data in it! There's one quick step that we have to do before that... \n",

This was to note that this is the standard way to import the Pandas library. We should always be sure that if we are importing the entire pandas library, we follow this syntax. It's common practice to use `pd` as the alias, and we tend to follow common practice whenever possible. This makes it easier for others to read our code."

The second is by reading in external data through the pandas module (which remembered we've imported and made accessible via `pd`).

If we want to grab entire rows or columns, then we can use bracket notation to do that (just like we use bracket notation to index into lists). If we want an entire column, then we're going to place the **column name** in brackets (and multiple column names in a list inside those brackets). We can also sometimes access a column via dot notation on the dataframe, which we'll show in a second. If we want an entire row, then we have to place **both** a **beginning and ending index** inside the brackets using slice notation `[start_index:end_index]` (it won't work to just place a single index in the brackets).

Note that these are **methods**, which means that we will call them via dot notation on our `DataFrame` object. The difference between these three has to do with how we use them. `loc[]` is a purely label-location based indexer, `iloc[]` is a purely integer-location based indexer, and `ix[]` is a primarily label-location based indexer that falls back to integer indexing.\n",

    "Pandas has functions for both filling nulls (or N/As) with whatever value we want, or dropping nulls all together. To fill nulls, we use the `.fillna()` method on the DataFrame, and to drop nulls, we call the `.dropna()` method on the DataFrame. In terms of the `.fillna()` function, we can give it a default value to fill in, or a number of other methods to fill it in (padding, back filling, foward filling). You can read about dealing with missing data in the docs [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#cleaning-filling-missing-data). We're not going to go into too much depth here, but want you to know that this functionality exists. "

    "## A quick aside on Pandas Series\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that in a couple of places, when we asked for certain rows/columns of the data, we got back a 1-D array that had an index attached. These are examples of what Pandas calls `Series`. In the documentation for [Pandas Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/dsintro.html#series), you can get an idea of what they can do. For the most part, we can kind of treat them like a mini DataFrame, as they have a lot of the same methods. However, there are some slight differences. Since we work with DataFrame's the majority of the time, we're not going to go into any real depth on Series. \n",

    "## A quick look at vizualization in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating vizualizations. Often times, we will probably be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and/or [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if we need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow us to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If we want something quick and dirty to visualize our data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization we would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Tonight we'll look at one or two examples - since most of the time we'll be doing your visualization in Matplotlib or Seaborn, we'll just give you a taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. We'll look at Seaborn and Matplotlib in a little bit more depth in a later class. "
